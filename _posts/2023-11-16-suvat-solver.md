Hey folks!

I'm super excited to unveil a project that's close to my heart – the **SUVAT Solver**. This web-based tool is my latest creation aimed at simplifying kinematic calculations for students, educators, and physics aficionados.

## What's SUVAT Solver?

![SUVAT Equations](https://github.com/ReefSalty/suvat-solver/raw/main/suvat-results.png)

The SUVAT Solver is crafted to make motion and displacement problems a breeze. It utilizes the five critical SUVAT equations – linking displacement (s), initial velocity (u), final velocity (v), acceleration (a), and time (t) – to compute unknown variables in physics problems.

## Why is it Awesome?

### Features:

- **Versatility**: Calculate any of the five SUVAT variables when you provide the other three.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Just input your known values, and let the solver do its magic.
- **Unit Clarity**: Results include units (like m, m/s, m/s², s) for better understanding.
- **Export Functionality**: Get your solutions as an image, complete with watermark for authenticity.

### How to Use:

1. Visit the [SUVAT Solver](https://reefsalty.co.uk/suvat-solver/).
2. Enter three known SUVAT variables.
3. Click "Solve" to uncover the unknowns.
4. Export the results as an image for your records or presentations.

## Collaboration and Feedback

Your thoughts and contributions are invaluable! If you've got a feature in mind or spotted a bug, feel free to fork the repo, branch out, commit your changes, and hit me up with a pull request.
