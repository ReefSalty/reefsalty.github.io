Hey everyone,

Today, I'm excited to introduce my latest creation for my computer science class â€“ a **Caesar Cipher Web Application**. It's a simple yet effective tool for anyone fascinated by the world of cryptography.

## What's the Caesar Cipher Web App?

The Caesar Cipher is a classic method of encryption that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a set value. My web app brings this ancient technique into the digital age, allowing users to easily encrypt or decrypt text.

## Features:

- **Encryption and Decryption**: Input text and apply the Caesar Cipher to encrypt or decrypt it.
- **Customizable Shift Value**: Use a slider to select how many letters to shift.
- **Instant Results**: See the encrypted or decrypted text immediately.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for hassle-free usage.
- **Export Options**: Save your results as a text file for later reference.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/ReefSalty/CaesarCipher).
2. Open the folder and launch the web app in your browser.
3. Start encrypting or decrypting text right away!

## How to Use:

1. Visit the [Caesar Cipher Web App](https://reefsalty.co.uk/CaesarCipher).
2. Enter text for encryption or decryption.
3. Adjust the shift value using the slider.
4. Choose "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" to see the magic happen.
5. Export your result as a text file if needed.

## Join the Project:

I welcome contributions! If you're interested in improving or adding new features to the app, here's how you can get involved:

1. Fork the GitHub repo.
2. Create a new feature branch.
3. Commit your enhancements.
4. Push the branch and create a pull request.

I hope you find this tool both fun and educational. Cryptography has always been a fascinating area for me, and I'm glad to share this passion through my web app.

Happy encrypting!
